516,"Sexually frustrated with BF on Citalopram (it's my cakeday and I need to get laid damnit) I'm actually on the other end of this and looking for advice from anyone who's experienced a similar situation.

I'm in a fairly new relationship (yes homo) and my boyfriend (28) is on Citalopram. All of the other elements for a healthy relationship are in place, but our sex life is almost non-existent.

While I am still in the natural beginning stages of a relationship where I can get instantly hard just from being around him, he has low libido, disinterest in sex, erectile dysfunction, can't achieve orgasm and, as you can imagine, has performance anxiety because of it all.

I know he is frustrated and I do feel empathy for his situation, but as a healthy, horny, handsome 27 (as of today) y/o male, I feel like I'm missing out on the important/exciting physical part that happens at the beginning of a relationship. I'm mostly disturbed that his feeling (because of the medication) is not just a disinterest in sex, but a disregard for his disinterest in sex.

I've been sensitive about the situation, and even gone as far as to wank before we hang out so there's less pressure, but even though I know it's just side effects, it leaves me feeling sexually frustrated, deprived, demasculated and insecure.

Is there anything I can do to help him? Is my behavior/approach wrong? Should I bail? Is this what I have to look forward to?

TL;DR - Boyfriend is on Citalopram and sex drive is wiped out. I need to cum. It's my birthday.

2668,"I'm a senior in college, have no idea what the fuck to do with my life after, and need to lose weight to have any prospects of getting with girls I'm going to waste a lot of time typing this out, but I feel that it's necessary to vent somewhere before I absolutely lose my fucking mind. A lot of you all will sit here and tell me that it's a sob story and that you don't feel bad for me based on the description, but hear me out because I'm depressed as fuck and I really don't know where I'm going in life right now. I'm 22, I'm a senior in college and I am in a funk. They say that these are the years to live it up and look back on as the most fun times of your life, and don't get me wrong, I've had some great times but I really don't know if what I did here was worth my time. I'm graduating as a political science major in the spring with a 2.7, a mildly shitty GPA. I have no interest in pursuing this field, and the more classes I take the more I realize that. I got fired from my internship this summer. I was working at a spanish law firm, which I thought was a good fit because my minor is legal spanish,  but I got fired because my spanish wasn't good enough, and I pretty much sat around the entire time doing nothing. There were two lawyers there and neither one of them had time to teach me about anything in the field. I had training from one of the paralegals who I was supposed to be taking over for, but I honestly had no idea what the fuck I was doing the whole time and they just got rid of me because I was getting paid 10 bucks an hour to do nothing. I voluntarily quit on my last day of my restaurant job which was the other job I was working at the time, I was bussing tables and working my ass off the entire summer and just got fed up with people bitching me and decided to take the last day off. Despite me telling them that I wasn't coming in, they told me not to come back in the winter, and I could have really used the money to sustain my drinking habit over winter break. 
              So I'm sitting here with a set of discussion questions due for my international ethics class, but I really have no idea what I'm reading. Shit was due at 9, its 11, I keep getting extensions in this class to have my assignments due. I've got an outline for a research paper due tomorrow too, so that will probably be keeping me up for the rest of the night. I literally am concerned for myself, because I might actually be stupid. All these kids at this college know what they're talking about, and not only do I not know what the context behind their responses to questions, I just don't care at all. I'm wasting my parents money on a degree that isn't even marketable. Two summers ago I got in the best shape of my life, I lost 25 pounds and got ripped, which didn't even matter because I have zero game and can't talk to girls if my life fucking depended on it. I'm fat again, wohooo one year of constantly working out put to waste, thats depressing right? Lol so funny story, here's where you probably won't give a fuck, but I'll just tell you anyways. So somehow I got into the best fraternity on campus as a freshman. That was back when I was a raging fattie, so how it worked out, not sure. Guess I have a chill personality. Well, turns out that being in the best fraternity still doesn't get you laid if you have no game, even when you're in great shape and have a great mindset. I've pretty much said the dumbest things to the brothers and went from being the vice president at one point to being the almost inactive, creepy piece of shit that stands around at parties and doesnt talk to girls. Don't I sound like the type of person you love to hate? I'm fucking jewish, I have a fucking big nose, I'm unathletic as shit, my parents aren't proud of me, I have zero prospects coming out of this place and honestly? If I put in a little bit of hard work, things would work out. Life is just getting the best of me right now, and it's hard to think positively and keep negativity out of my life because I'm stressed the fuck out and have a terrible addiction to tobacco. I blow way too much cocaine, drink til I pass out, and wake up every fucking day without a bitch. Why the fuck do I suck, and should I kill myself? Probably, idk, I'm just trying to gauge whether or not I'm an average joe or someone that might actually have potential. Thanks people on the internet, you make life way more interesting.

We basically do the following

* All 3rd party JS libraries are pulled down from a CDN
* All 3rd party CSS libraries are stored locally, and we serve up one minified file per library
* We have one minified CSS file for all of our 1st party CSS code
* We have one minified JS file for all of our 1st party JS code

The logic for using CDN's for JS, but not for CSS, is that we also follow progressive enhancement guidelines, which means that the core content is available without Javascript. So, if the CDN goes down it doesn't matter. If we used the CDN for CSS too, then users would receive a much worse experience visiting the site, while the CDN was down.

You can [see it here](https://github.com/brianbrennan/slimpickin). I was wondering what the best way of keeping versions organized, since I'm pretty sure I'll release updates later on. I was also wondering what the best way to write up the docs is. Right now, I just have some quick and dirty documentation on my README. I imagine that is not the best idea. So yeah, any advice as I delve into this new open source realm would be great",Happy,Happy,0.015098103,[0.00746523 0.9850153  0.00751944],0.9850153,True

833,"Are there good Python alternatives to pandas that don't store datasets in memory? One of the ostensible selling points of Python over R is that Python supposedly deals better with large data sets, as it doesn't store datasets in memory. However, I recently learned from this very subreddit that pandas stores datasets in memory. 

Given how frequently data scientists can need to deal with very large datasets, are there any good alternatives to pandas that doesn't do this, or ways around this, etc? Otherwise, given how essential I've always understood pandas to be to data science in Python, the language seems to lose a major advantage in its favor.

2117,"Best friend of 6 years, Boyfriend of 4 months... Depressive spell causing end of relationship First off, this is a throwaway account, but he knows about it. We don't hide anything from one another. We are both avid redditors and seek advice often from the community. 

For a detailed background on our relationship see this post from about 5 months ago: http://redd.it/jeed3

He started on Cymbalta around August, and immediately started feeling better. It was like he could see clearly again. We were both in awe of how much better he was. We started officially dating 9.10.11 and I thought things were going unbelievably well. We have both been through a lot, and spent the Holidays with each other's families while I was home from school. I have never been happier in my life, and I assumed the same from him, as that is what he told me...

Until two days ago, New Year's Eve. I brought up that he was being distant and asked if everything was alright. He unloaded that he wasn't happy... Not necessarily because of our relationship but just in general and all he could feel was apathetic. He admitted that it might be because of a depressive spell, and a lapse in his medications effectiveness. But when I went to his house to confront him, he could barely even look me in the eye. I packed up a lot of my stuff, since I stayed over there a lot, devastated and in tears. He cried as well as he held me, and I asked if it was the end. He wouldn't break up with me, but insisted repeatedly that he needed some time and space to figure things out. He said he would call me in a few days...

I have never been more crushed. I wrote him this following letter, and left it on his computer desk for him to read. I will post the shortened version as follows: 

I love you… I know that is the first, and last thing you want to hear right now. But you have absolutely nothing to feel guilty for. Which I know is one of the main things you are worried about. You aren’t “putting me through” anything. I chose you, as you did me. I knew the moment I met you, years ago that I loved you. We have been through so much together, and this isn’t any different. I knew the person you were, and vice versa when I decided to be with you, and I wouldn’t ever want you to change. That doesn’t mean that I am not completely supportive of you getting help, and hopefully starting to feel better. I know depression is a disease, and it does not simply walk away when you love someone. I’m not naïve. But I also know that I’m not going anywhere. This isn’t to make you anxious or guilty; this is just me stating that I am here. I get you need time, and maybe even space. But I refuse to let you go through this all alone. I said: Whenever, Wherever, Whatever and I meant it. I know you feel apathetic, lethargic and generally don’t know how to feel about our relationship, because you aren’t thinking rationally right now. Depression is hard, and painful, and hurtful for everyone involved. But you don’t have to worry about me. I love you, with all my heart. I’m not saying love is a miracle cure, but it certainly isn’t hurting you… I would hope. I get you feel like you have to please me, and put on a smiling face. I don’t expect you to. I love you the way you are, and I feel like if we can continue to communicate and set boundaries that we can work through this. Because despite what you feel, or don’t feel now… I know you are in love with me. I know you want to be with me. I know with every part of my being, that what we have is real, and unique. Your dad was right. We are the only two people crazy enough to deal with one another’s crazy. I can’t think of more perfect way to put it. I know that dealing with things with your Mom and feeling anxious and guilty about your brother has really taken its toll on you, mentally. I can’t even begin to know what you’re going through, and I know that thinking about all the stuff with her, and getting in contact with her again brings up your hurt feelings towards women in general, of which I am included. But I am not her… Or any other women that has wronged you. You know me, better than anyone… ever. As I know you. I don’t expect that this letter will magically fix everything. But I just needed you to know, that I love you, I am here for you, and I am refuse to go anywhere. You’ve pushed me away before, and you finally started to see things clearly. Just because you are in a depressive fog, and it is hard to feel, and see what and who I am to you, doesn’t mean that your feelings for me have changed. It means that you are upset, and hurting, and feel guilty. Like I said, you shouldn’t. I know what you’re going through is extremely tiring, and takes a toll on your mental, physical, and emotional state. But that doesn’t mean that you have to let me go… That isn’t what you want, or I want. It might feel like things would be easier without me, but I promise you that is the depression talking.  I can’t make you stay with me, but I’m stubborn enough not to go anywhere. You once said that you knew I was the one because you had gone through so much pain, and hurt, and distance and when the smoke cleared, I was the only one left standing right in front of you. Well, this is me standing right in front of your still, forever and ever. I love you.

**So, I ask you this Reddit.** Have I done all I can? I fully intend to fight for this man... We are perfect together. And I can't help but think that this is the depression talking... But I need advice. He said he needed space, and with the exception of a midnight New Years text, I haven't tried to contact him. I am waiting for his call, his decision... 

Please, let me know what you think. It'll be nice talking it out, cause having all these thoughts swirling around in my head isn't healthy.

I've traveled to all the corners of the interwebs looking for public/open-source data sets and even though many are really great, it's not what I'm looking for. So I guess my options are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Look for premium data sets
2. Create my own
3. Ask Reddit :-)

&amp;#x200B;

The sets I'm looking for centers around physical goods (the actual product is not important), medium to high volume, and sets on both the procurement and sales sides. What I mean by these is, a set with data on purchase price, discounts, staggers, etc, and a set with data on sales price, uplift, margin, etc. Sort of, end-to-end supply chain data. The more and diverse sets the better, to practice my relational thinking.

Do you know premium data sets that have these? I honestly have no clue how much these cost.

Or do you think that I likely need to create these myself? If so, any tips on making these? Do you use specific apps to generate product names, numbers, etc?

2790,"[math / sociology] Is there any plausible explanation that in statistics like Kinsey report, heterosexual females are generally reported to have a smaller number of average sexual partners than males? Can this be explained plausibly by strong differences in behaviour across subgroups ? I am a trained physicist and don't get my head wrapped around that, so somebody else might try to explain this to me:

Many studies and statistics contend that heterosexual males have more frequently extramarital sex than females, and have on average a higher number of sexual partners. But in my opinion, if one tries to write up how this is supposed to work, this leads quickly to very implausible numbers.

As an example, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extramarital_sex

 &gt; American researcher Alfred Kinsey found in his 1950-era studies that 50% of American males and 26% of females had extramarital sex. [2] Depending on studies, it was estimated that 26-50% of men and 21-38% of women,[3] or 22.7% of men and 11.6% of women had extramarital sex.[4]...

For the sake of simplicity, I will omit homosexual people, polygamous / polyamorous people, and sex between more than two people from the following consideration - it will not change the conclusion significantly as long as this is truly uncommon behaviour. Also, I exclude paid sex as it was excluded in statistics like Kinsey. It is clear that not everone is ""normal"", however let's focus on the consistency about what is known about '""normal"" people.

The puzzling point is this: We know that to every sexual encounter belong two people. Also, the great majority of people behaves mostly heterosexual, that means that for every male having a sexual relationship there is a female participating, too. 

**If these numbers mentioned above were consistent, the number of sexual partners per percentile in the population would need to be vastly different for men and woman.** As a slightly exaggerated example, let's assume that each male has on average two sexual partners and each female only one. Of course, it is possible that males in certain subgroups behave different from females in corresponding subgroups. But this would need to be balanced in the union set of all groups.

We now can make assumptions how, for example, the numbers are distributed across [percentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile). One of the possible distributions looks like this:

    D = Decile 
    nm = average number of partners in heterosexual males 
    nf = average number of partners in heterosexual females
    S = sum of sexual partners across all deciles

     D   nm  nf
     1    2    0
     2    2    1
     3    2    1
     4    2    1
     5    2    1
     6    2    1
     7    2    1
     8    2    1
     9    2    1
    10    2   12
     --------------
     S   20   20

In short, one ultra-promiscous woman would need to make up for the chastity of nine others by having twelve times more sexual partners than her fellow women. Still, both sexes would have an average of two sexual partners each. This distribution can't explain the numbers from Kinsey and others, and in fact no distribution in which the summed number of partners across all deciles are equal can.In any such distribution, the average number of partners for heterosexual males and females will be equal! 

This just isn't plausible. One can try to explain this by arguing that married and unmarried persons behave different in both sexes. It is often maintained that men do have more extramarital affairs, but this would have the consequence that unmarried females are far more promiscuous than men, which is even less plausible. Is there any more logical distribution? How is the number of sexual partner actually distributed across percentiles for both sexes and for the married / unmarried populations? Is there any plausible explanation for average numbers of sexual partners  that are not equal?

To be clear, I have divided the total number of males/females in quantiles, but I think this would hold for any complete division in subgroups of age, relationship status, or whatever.

To bring it down to mathematics, let's say you have N objects of class X and N objects of class Y. There can be connections between objects of class X and Y and you can say with certainty that for every connection of an X with an Y, there is a connection between an Y and an X, because these connections are mutual. Now, somebody claims that there are certain subsets of X objects which have fewer connections that the Y objects in the corresponding groups, and my conclusion is that there need to be subsets of X which balance the total number of connections because **the average number of connections for both classes of objects must always be the same.** ",Happy,Happy,0.029143887,[0.01483961 0.9712767  0.0138837 ],0.9712767,True

4415,"Fathers absence to blame?  *rant mode activate* ^boop! Hi /r/drepession, I'm 20. I've grown up without a father, I've never met him. Early on in middle school and on to about grade 10 I think I was harassed by what I perceived as unauthentic, egocentric, arrogant, apathetic, paternalistic, elitist, condescending, provincial,  hypocritical douche bags for being myself, and having red hair. (this changed when I joined a year long program for gifted students that took me on what I perceived as an intellectual adventure of development and empathy) What I want to know reddit, is **what's your experience growing up without a father?** 

**my expereice**: my mother may have done her best, but at one time or another I started to realize that there is a major hole in my interpersonal/intrapersonal education. It may have come in the form of not being able to hold my own in a an argument or immediately feeling flustered when confrontation arises (outside of the frequent belligerent, cruel, and one-sided arguments I had with my mother that which to this day I *hate* myself for). I frequently don't feel worthy of social approval or validation. I frequently struggle to hold on to friendships. I've been told that some individuals that have grown up without fathers feel the subconscious need to test other's trust in a response to being rejected by a supposed family member. This I think has led me to lose several good friends. ""friends"" who in response to this shitty behavior have mistook remorse for public/private self victimization. I have always had anger issues. (interestingly, I wonder if any of this is the case or just a flawed psychoanalysis.) Trying to understand why I do the things I do keeps me up at night. It has now for years. 

For years I've sat with many different therapist offices for hours trying to understand and 'fix' myself. I feel as though I am surrounded by people who have no capacity to see where it is that I'm coming from (so to speak). **So I've come here in the hopes of finding people like me**: people who graduated from the class of ""they were fucking wrong an I'm going to prove it"" and went on to a fancy university thinking it was the fucking promised land where you didn't get fucked with ever and with the hopes of meeting someone who will magically change a negative perception of reality and fix the problems that you have had for ages. People who think that the best form of revenge is to simply be successful academically, socially, financially, or otherwise but can't seem to due to the habitual (as opposed to intellectual) notion and/or understanding that there is some inherent problem with his/herself and of his/her psyche. People who have tried to kill themselves but could never muster the courage to actually do it. **Lastly, and most importantly, I'm looking for people who question weather or not they actually have problems or if it's psychosomatic, self-perpetuating, and/or unrealistic.**

1401,"My two cents Depression is a bitch. It can seep into your daily life without you even knowing it. It can warp your perspective on the world, affect your relationships with others, and most importantly affect your health. But like most ailments there are treatments available. It can also serve as an indication from your mind that something is right, be it in your body or mind. Although everyone is different physiologically, psychologically, and has different problems, I believe there are some things that are universal.

Exercise - Everyone can benefit from exercise. It doesn't matter if it's going for a run, shooting around a basketball, even a walk around the block will improve your mood. Exercise releases endorphins to help you feel good again. It is a constant struggle to exercise for everybody, but I promise you once you do it you will feel more motivated, you will breathe easier, and your mind will be clearer. It is an essential need for the body along with eating adequate nutrients. Building the idea up in your mind will only make it harder to achieve, so just do it. Don't overthink it. Sometimes in life we have to go out on precarious limbs so to speak and do things that seem scary, but in the end are totally worth it.

Cues - Bodily cues are a little way to help improve confidence, reduce anxiety, and ultimately help you look and feel better. It's the little things like looking up instead of down, taking deep breaths in your nose and out your mouth, working on your posture, speaking louder, maintaining eye contact, taking up more space instead of shrinking down, its the 'fake it till you make it' way to build confidence. By observing others who are confident and modeling them one may begin to feel as they do. 

Unfulfillment - A sense of self-worth can extend from many different areas, whether it be pursuing a creative endeavor, financial security, in search of acceptance from others, or a myriad of other first world issues that may be weighing on your mind. There are a million resources out there to help you learn a skill that you want, and get you out of the rut. While it's important to achieve your goals, it's also important to set smaller, more achievable goals first. It might be helpful to think of a percentage of your goal getting accomplished, like if every workout you got 1% closer to getting buff, and 25% closer to meeting your weekly goal of working out 4 times a week. Doing the things that you want are extremely fulfilling and rewarding, and can give one a sense of purpose, which is essential in living life. 

Helping Others - There is absolutely nothing more fulfilling than helping those in need. By doing volunteer work, tutoring, writing, and donating to charity, you are giving back to the community and getting involved in what matters to you. I recently did some volunteer work by cleaning up debris around a nearby river and I swear I never felt better, especially after the debilitating process of finding a job. 

So there is good out there no matter how bad it may seem. Remember: time heals all wounds. Odds are there is someone there who cares about you. Don't make the ultimate sacrifice over something that is not worth it. Although they may not totally understand what you're going through, there are tons of good people out there who would want to help you in a time of need.

2372,"I Remember (A poem I wrote to help me feel better today) *Trigger warning: This poem is about my personal experience with domestic violence, drugs, and child abuse. It might trigger others with similar experiences.*

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

The smell of my closet, where I used to hide for hours

The words they used to scream at each other

The image of my father dragging my mother down the hallway

Hearing my mother yell at me to just close the door

That time, when he broke the car window to get at her

Crying, scared, and alone in my room trying to hide

Wishing that it would all be over, that they would just stop

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

The first time my mother cried in front of me

The first time she used me for support

Carrying the burden of all her stress on my shoulders

Feeling her hot tears running down my back as she gripped me 
close

Trying to be as quiet as possible, so that I didn’t make things worse

Watching my sister cause World War III every night

Trying to avoid being stuck alone with my broken mother

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

How her tears used to bring me sadness

How I used to feel sorry for her, and wish that I could change it all

The day that her tears began to anger me

The day that the sound of her crying made my stomach burn

The moment when I became disgusted with the pile of pieces in 
front of me

That moment when I realized I wasn’t allowed to be a child anymore

How I felt when she held me, simultaneously apologizing and 
begging

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

The anger and resentment I felt having to cater to my sister’s moodswings

How joy turned to fear, when a simple sleepover turned into a medical situation

The confusion of her going through withdrawal in my own bed

How sweaty and agonizing her situation seemed to be

How I felt when I learnt that it was something she had done to 
herself

The mix of pain and hope that each letter from rehab instilled

The disbelief and anger when I learned her father let her out of 
there

The disgust and bewilderment of her relapsing

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

How she used to hotbox the car when she drove me to work

When I caught her smoking, and she told me to never light up

The confusion when a year later she constantly begged me to get high with her

The loneliness and pain of losing my sister, after our family had been ripped apart

How angry I was when she would laugh at me for not wanting to to drugs

The way that I felt when I found out my mom was just as bad

The day that I lost all respect for the sister that I used to idolize

The day that I renounced my mother as my own

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

My father approaching me, asking for permission to get divorced

The awkwardness of having to tell him to be happy, when it was the last thing I wanted

How quickly he accepted my blessing after our talk

The anger of having to pretend to console my mother when he left

Having to hear her badmouth him every chance she got

Missing my father being home

Feeling trapped with a crazy woman who clung to me like a leech

Counting down the days until I could move out

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

How she began whoring herself out at the local bars

The fear I felt when I realized she didn’t make it home

Calling her, texting her, and stewing in confusion and my own thoughts

Hopping into my car, determined to go find her

How sure I was that she was going to be dead in a ditch in a wrecked car

The anger I felt when she came home so casually and carefree

How disgusted I was when she brought a shiny new toy home

How she tried to force this strange man into my life

The disgust I felt when I learned he is almost the same age as my sister

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

That night, when I called him an “it” out of anger

How she turned on me, and told me to go to my room

When I snuck out of the basement, and drove off so that I wouldn’t have to be there

That moment, when I realized I didn’t have anywhere else to go

Walking around the house, and finding the basement door locked

The dread of having to walk into the front of the house and having to see her

How I contemplated driving to the park and sleeping in my car instead

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

That moment, when she chose not to go to my wedding, because he wasn’t invited

Getting married with only my in laws present

When I realized that I love his parents more than I love my own

Being truly grateful, and happy that my own mother did not attend

How sad I felt, that my father was not there

The pain from my father slowly drifting further away from me

When I realized that I hadn’t talked to him in months

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

When he brought the whore that he was cheating with to supper

Eating a meal I couldn’t taste, because of my anger over her being there

How she tried so damn hard to get my approval

The joy of getting to tell her, one-on-one what I really thought of her

How scared I was about what my father would say when he found out

The moment when my father’s dad said they should have stayed together

When I realized that my father’s parents weren’t as bad as I thought

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

How my biological father used to love me

The moment when he introduced me to the hellspawn he was dating

The day I realized she absolutely hated my guts

How lonely I felt, sitting in the basement or attic or outside all day long

The fear of realizing she had locked me outside, and not knowing for how long

How my heart hurt, whenever he tried to spend time with me only 
to be called away

When I learned that she was addicted to drugs, and so was he

How scared I was to eat at the dining room table with her home

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

Being so confused whenever her children and grandchildren came over

Not understanding why she suddenly treated me better than trash

When I realized that her kin had no idea how she actually felt about me

How hurt I felt watching her give affection to anyone but me

The moment when I decided that I didn’t care if she loved me

The day that I realized she never would

How the highlight of my day was when my biological father would bring me a meal

Not because I was hungry, but because those few moments were precious to me

&amp;nbsp;

I remember

How he called me, and yelled at me when the adoption papers were sent to him

That he said “it’s just a name” and didn’t realize I needed a father

That he blamed me for all of this happening

How I actually believed him

The last drive we took to his house together

How silent the car was, and how I immediatly just wanted to go back home

When I realized neither house was really a home or a safe place for me

The fear of going to court, and talking to a judge like I saw on T.V.

How happy I was when I got to call my step-father, my father

&amp;nbsp;

982,"Helping programmers with focus problems as a manager I have a very small team and the biggest problem with our output is definitely losing focus through the day, from what I can see and self-diagnosis. Day projects turn into week projects with no end in sight sometimes.

I've been reading about what I can do as a manager and the answers I've found don't seem entirely satisfying. We generally chit chat through the day about what we're working on or what's giving up trouble so an agile/scrum meeting wouldn't make sense I don't think. 

I've read that putting emphasis on taking a break can help with focus and I may try that but it's common enough for a discussion to happen through the day on some video game or other topic for 10 or 15 minutes and is then followed by some more redditing from what I can see so break-taking doesn't seem to be an issue. 

The only time I felt we had real focus as a team was when deadlines were looming but that's stressful and I don't want to try and force that feeling all the time. I also notice there's less news checking/redditing/facebook when the owner is in. I'm not 100% sure that translates to real work getting done or just looking busy but it's something.

2174,"The Art Of Learning For Software Developers Hello everybody!

Learning is a big  part of our job, as developers. There is a lot to know to be productive, more efficient, and more effective.

But it can be difficult to know what to learn, how to learn it, and how to apply the new knowledge in different situations. 

Over the years, I spent a lot of time trying to improve my learning techniques. Now, I would like to share them with you with this article: https://thevaluable.dev/learning-developer-efficiently-effectively/

Any feedback is welcome!

tl;dr:

* Learning includes understanding, remembering, and applying the knowledge in different situations (transfer).
* Ask yourself these important questions: why do you want to learn? How much do you want to learn? What do you want to achieve with t11his knowledge?
* Having an environment free of distraction and applying the 5 minutes rule can help you to get started.
* Choose the learning material considered good by a majority of your peers.
* Go through it, and try to practice the knowledge gained as soon as you can.
* Test your new knowledge to be sure you really learned it, and to bring the new knowledge in your long term memory.
* Seek internal and external feedback. Train yourself to squeeze as much as you can from them.",Happy,Happy,0.016445914,[0.00633723 0.9836886  0.00997424],0.9836886,True
4436,"After 10 years of dreaming of this day, I finally bought a house!!! I'm a single mom of a beautiful, intelligent 6 year old, haven't heard from her father since the day she was born, and haven't seen a penny from him either. I've been working part time as a secretary for two years, and putting myself through college to get my paralegal degree, and have been doing odd jobs here and there throughout the long process.
Many people have tried to discourage me from owning my own home, including my own parents, telling me I couldn't do it for one reason or another. 
I turned 30 this year, and decided that I wanted to make some positive changes in my life, including buying a house for my daughter to grow up in, and so she and my two dogs could have a real backyard to run and play in. So, I got to looking.
I spoke with several realtors, knowing I couldn't do this process on my own, and half of them told me I needed to buy something more than I knew I could afford, and the other half told me I couldn't afford a house unless it was in the slums. Finally, I found the perfect realtor, who understood what I was looking for, who listened to my concerns, and helped me every step of the way.
After a month of searching, I found a house I fell in love with! Great schools for my daughter, completely remodeled, and 15 minutes from work! There were a few kinks in the process, and many very stressful moments when I thought it would fall through. The only thing that kept me going was my determination and encouragement from my friends.
Now, it's very late, I have to be up for work in 5 hours, but I'm so happy that I finally have my very own house, I have stayed up way too late unpacking! I almost can't believe this is really true and happening!! ^_^
My daughter loves her new school and her new room, the dogs love the freedom of running in the backyard without a leash, and I finally have a kitchen big enough to really cook in and room to entertain my friends!! :) 
I've never been happier in my life!!! ^_^

2235,"If my depression were to manifest and become an entity, I imagine it would be similar to a dementor For those of you unfamiliar with the Harry Potter films (taken from the wiki)

""Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.""

A Dementor is a non-being and Dark creature, considered one of the foulest to inhabit the world. Dementors feed upon human happiness, and thus cause depression and despair to anyone near them. They can also consume a person's soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state, and thus are often referred to as ""soul-sucking fiends"". They are known to leave a person as an 'empty-shell'.

The Assignment:
Social networks monitoring and automatic interaction are key elements to minimize the damage and to improve business at the same time. The number of different media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, YouTube, Linkedin, Blogpost, etc) and the gigantic number of new posts per day present us a huge challenge that requires:

• Knowledge about how to automatically interact with the current social media;

• Tools and mechanisms to extract, transform and temporarily store data from the social media (monitor -&gt; store data for further processing); 

• Tools and mechanisms to properly answer posts, make announcements and interact with potential groups, communities or customers;

• Huge processing capacity, only possible throughout cloud computing. 


The teams are invited to research and develop a solution that automatically extracts and store temporary data from the social media for further processing (monitor social media). Some of the features to be considered are:

Current social media may be replaced at any moment for new alternatives (who talks about Orkut nowadays?). So, the proposed solution must be conceived as a general framework.

The proposed solution must deal* with at least one of the established social media (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Linkedin, Blogspot, etc) must implement an extraction process

The proposed solution must be able to handle a huge amount of information generated every day.

Data has to be extracted on an hourly/daily basis in order to allow a trend analysis*;trend analysis is not part of this challenge

The proposed solution should consider the ability to filter posts/conversations according to some filter parameters to limit the number of stored data;

Identification of who drives the conversation (from which sites the conversation starts) is desirable;

Information about the location of customers that have generated the posts (country/ state/ city) is desirable;

2121,"Data Science and Marketing? Hello all:

Please forgive me if this type of post is not allowed or has already been answered somewhere. I am currently acting as a Director of Marketing for a medium-sized business. Most of my work revolves around digital marketing strategy and execution. As I examine the business landscape, it's become apparent that statistics and analysis are becoming more and more prevalent when making marketing decisions. 

Next spring, my company is paying for me to complete the Graduate Certificate in Marketing Management &amp; Digital Strategy at Harvard. I was checking out their website and noticed that they had some free Data Science courses. If you don't mind, I have a few questions for the community:

* My impression is that data science can integrate with marketing. Am I correct here, or should I be looking for something different?
* It seems that the free courses at Harvard are through edX. Assuming the answer to the above question is ""yes"", will this program give me the knowledge I seek?
* I took a few calculus and statistics courses during my MBA tenure, but it's been a few years. Should I refresh my abilities or will this be covered in the material?

So my question is about responsiveness, I was taught that when doing responsiveness i could use my chrome dev tools and check my website in different resolutions.

Looking at it on my desktop with the dev tools in that resolution it looked fine but switching my resolution to 1366x768 under the display settings I saw a different result.

3629,"It's not a matter of not being loved, it's just an incapacitating feeling that makes you withdraw from everyone to protect yourself. It's not that I don't feel loved. It's not that I have nothing going for me either. I have a successful business that I started almost two years ago and a decent paying job pushing papers which covers the massive debt I have from school. I'm attractive and I'm told I'm funny and charismatic. I feel awful about myself though, no matter what.  I don't have the heart to say that I'm such a fake or different person around everyone.  I'm really wonderful at manipulating people.  I seem so genuine when I'm counting down the seconds until I can let it drop and I can just curl up and sleep.

I've systematically shut out all of the people that I know would probably help me through these feelings.  I meant to say, they've helped me before.  I don't have the energy to maintain friendships anymore.  My family isn't the most functional.  I spent most of my childhood alone while my parents were still chasing the dreams of being kids themselves.  My dad and stepmother drink a lot.  My mother is a shut in, she never speaks to anyone outside of my stepfather and I.  At least before I told her I never wanted to associate with her again.

 I'm living from couch to couch or in my car, packed full with the few items I've decided were necessity.  I never thought I would end up like this.

I haven't been sleeping very well. Aches and pains. I'm just so exhausted all of the time, but sleep doesn't really come easily. I've been chasing exhaustion with bad tv shows on my laptop, sitting in the Starbucks parking lot leeching wifi. I can engross myself into the movie or show and forget about myself for a minute or two. I devour whole seasons in a day grabbing for that brief respite.  

But the feelings have taken on this new life in my mind... I've tried before to end it. Hospitals and doctors were the result.  The worst being when I was hospitalized.  I swore I would never end up back in a place like that afterwards.  Sitting in my pajamas with no socks or shoes in a psychiatric er for 24 hours with a bleeding wrist.  They didn't have any beds available, they barely checked on me.  The cuts weren't enough to hurt me, but it was deep enough that it should have gotten attention of some sort... Probably stitches according to the psychiatrist I met with later.  I don't remember if I meant to kill myself or just hurt myself.  I was black out drunk after my ex knocked me over the back of the couch after I confronted him about cheating.

 I just sort of manipulated my way through the following sessions until I would stop going all together. I'm a ""non-compliant patient"". You can tell them what they want to hear and they feel better. They feel vital. They helped save a girl, so when you stop coming they don't really pursue it.

But the feelings have changed... Where I used to reach out to people, I've stopped replying to them. Avoid them. Delete the messages before I even open them. I'm crippled with that sensation of loneliness and anxiety. I spend most of my time with my boyfriend. He's wonderful... But he doesn't put much stock in emotions, he isn't understanding in that respect.  He says there is no such thing as depression, or anxiety, that it's in your head and its just that weak people behave like that.

 We've been together 3 years in August and he hasn't told me he loves me. But he's all I have. He knows I love him.  I think he loves me too, but he isn't the type to show it. I think he might be the only reason I haven't cut all contacts and ran away to a place where no one knows me.

I've done a lot of stupid and unforgivable things in my past.  I've gotten drunk and slept with people who would give me some sort of brief affection. I've taken people for granted. The guilt of making such a huge fool of myself so many times and being hurt by so many people that I loved... It's indescribable.  Why did I do those things, why did I let them do that to me, why did I think that was a good idea?  This guilt is incapacitating.

I just don't want to try anymore, things I used to love don't motivate me, I'm just crushed with sadness all the time. It's really not that I don't feel loved. I really do have a lot going for me.

Stemming from this [AskScience discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1g9clk/can_anyone_accurately_explain_alcohol_colories/) based on alcohol metabolism and caloric usage, it seems prudent to raise the subject of hangovers.

As the hepatic pathway for [metabolism of alcohol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Citrate.gif) is fairly well-known in biochemistry, I will glibly simplify it to alcohol (ethanol) ---alcohol dehydrogenase---&gt; acetaldehyde + H2O + NAD^+ ---aldehyde dehydrogenase---&gt; NADH + H^+ Acetate. 

What I think would be a good discussion would be including but not limited to the following:

* the limiting factors of metabolism
* supplements which can help or hinder these reactions
* pathologies resultant from excess alcohol or inhibited enzymes along the pathway
* ongoing and current research into the arena
* what the body is lacking during a hangover period
* what is myth and fact in consumption and recovery
* all else.

Again, this was originally stirred due to a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1g9clk/can_anyone_accurately_explain_alcohol_colories/cai5u78) in the original thread stating that Acetylcysteine would serve as a stand-in for glutathione, so this is an open-discussion on current research and otherwise.

2875,"Telemarketers are people too 
Saw this on a Facebook group. Made me smile.
 Copy pasted


I had been up since 5 am, worked until 12, and when I just got back to my apt. I went to sleep. I was woken up by my phone ringing. I answered. It was Iyogi tech support. 

They were calling me about my laptop, same as they did two years ago, accept this time I didn't fall for there very basic scam. I wanted to hang up. I used to make a habit of never hanging up on telemarketers that were not machines, but during the school year I got out of the habit because I just didn't have time to talk. Today, I was groggy, but I didn't have anywhere to be, and I did not want to just hang up on her, she seemed nice. 

She tried her pitch about how slow my laptop is and isn't working properly but I've heard it all before so I didn't waste her breath. I just started telling her about my day, how she woke me up (she then jokingly said that I was a lazy bones) and how I just got back from work, and I told her I wanted to hang up, but I liked her so I wouldn't. I could hear her smile.

 Of course i immediately told her about my girlfriend and how I was very taken and completely in love with Erin. But I was surprised. She wasn't cutting me off with her continued sales pitch and tales of my technological doom, she wasn't hanging up on me. She was listening. 
 
    At this point I didn't care if she did hang up, but I was going to be nice to her, and if your know me you that know that if there is a ear listening, my mouth will go. 

I told her everything i love about Erin, and how I would do anything for her. I described some of her cute little quirks and just how amazing she is and how much better my life is with her in it. 

Her voice grew a little sad as she told me that hearing me talk about Erin made her miss her ex. How she thought I was a great boyfriend and she missed being loved. I asked why she broke up with him and she told me it was because he physically abused her. We discussed her relationship, and I told her what I tell everyone I know that is single: there is someone out there for you, and they may not be in your life now because one of you isn't ready, God is saving you for each other, when it's right, in his time. 

 At the end of our conversation, she told me that I had made her day. She asked if it was OK if she called me again if she needed someone to talk to. A woman in India halfway around the world was brought a little joy just because I listened to her and treated her like a person, and not a machine. 

There is tons and tons of negativity out there in the world, I just told you guys this today because I want you to know, that no matter what you're doing or where you are in life, if you care about people, treat them well regardless of their age, race, or religious or political views, you make yourself the better person.",Neutral,Neutral,0.47217768,[0.36582756 0.01052981 0.6236427 ],0.6236427,True

352,"I recently went through a breakup and felt that I lost all of my friends until this... A few months ago I went through a terrible breakup. I was so depressed that I was hospitalized for a week and had to take a term off from school. My boyfriend broke up with me during visiting hours my second day there. Since then I've been seeing a therapist and getting better (truly have been) but sometimes I reflect on our mutual friends and felt that I had lost them. I met most of them through him, and I had never really hung out with them on my own. I've felt very lonely because of this, especially with one particular friend (we'll call him Y). Y was my bf's best friend, they lived together for over a year, I lived alone with Y as well while me and my bf were long distance briefly and I became very close with him. Then, for a couple months until my hospitalization, my bf, Y, and I lived together with a few other friends. I really loved Y, he was a great support for me throughout my depression and he was the one who urged me to go inpatient and seek help.

Y checked up on me once a week after I was discharged from the hospital, but then I slowly stopped reaching out and responding to him. I felt extremely guilty because he was my ex's best friend. I felt like I was a bit of a burden too. And I just didn't know what to talk about (that was probably mainly because I was still a little depressed and recovering, but it still affected how I felt).

Yesterday was my birthday and Y messaged me. So I thanked him. Today he asked me how I was doing, told me he wanted to talk soon. I told him that I felt like I couldn't be friends with him anymore, because my ex had been angry that Y had developed a friendship with one of his previous girlfriends, and that it felt like a conflict of interest if he is a supportive friend to me like he is with my ex.

And he responded with one of the most touching things I have ever heard.

He said:

&gt; Ok, but he doesn't decide who I'm friends with. I mean, it's unfortunate if it bothers him but I can't change my life for the sake of sensitivities. Listen, it's a nice gesture and I know you are serious about keeping things right but we can talk. It's really fine.

This might seem like such a small thing but I don't have many real friends. I've had a lot of situations when people I thought I was close to decided I wasn't worth sticking around for.

&gt; ""I said Hello.""

**Option 2.** The OP has to be in the form of a joke. So,

&gt; ""I said Hello.""

isn't all that entertaining. But something like

works a little better.

We'e told that there's something wrong when we don't feel happy. If we show unhappiness too obviously we are seen as 'downers'.

There is a thriving legal drug business that aims at turning sad people into happy people.  [1 in 6](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/1-in-6-americans-takes-a-psychiatric-drug/) Americans are on some kind of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medication.

What if we were to listen to this feeling? What if, looking around at how things are in the world, we didn't feel like smiling? What if, instead of looking the other way, and burying our troubles in shopping and entertainment, we acknowledged that maybe, just maybe ...the problem isn't that we are not positive?

I think part of the healing comes from acknowledging one's emotions in a genuine way. There is nothing wrong with feeling sad, or down.

912,"I've had my job for about 2 months and I'm getting unhappier with it every day. What should I do? I'm a web developer (PHP) at a semi-large company in Canada. I started as a contract job working on one of their client's sites but after about 2 weeks of me working there, they offered me full time. The company is mostly full of account managers with only about 4 of us doing the actual developer work. Literally 15:4 ratio. They of course make more money than all of us who actually code the sites.

Some of our major clients websites (that were made before I was there) are poorly coded and obviously rushed to meet deadlines. They all feel like they are patched on patches to fix this patch. A pile of bandaids if you will. Really confusing to work with pretty much all the time.

Us developers got an email the other day from our boss saying how disappointed he was in us for being slow with our work and making a lot of mistakes (mistakes as in ""this takes 2mins to fix"" mistakes, not losing client mistakes), and for generally being lazy. None of us believe we were THAT terrible at all, especially since we've stayed late (no overtime pay by the way) multiple times and some of us stayed overnight to do projects to fit their deadlines. Our boss just went on about how we're doing poorly and swore multiple times in the email in a REALLY unprofessional way.

I'm just generally stressed out and unhappy working there (as are the other developers) and I really can't take much more, and after that email I'm completely checked out and just don't care anymore. The pay is good and I like doing this kind of work, it's just the attitude from the company/boss that really gets to me.

I'm also moving soon, so having money right now is kind of a big deal. Best case scenario is I quit when I find another place, but I don't know if I can last that long without getting completely depressed.

You manifest it. That’s how. 
Now, My point is not to blame my woes and my difficulties on anything or anyone but myself. 
I can recall a post I wrote on Facebook expressing my fear about the new presidency. I believe it read- ME- Black, Jew, lesbian. I’M TERRIFIED. 
I was terrified. My fear was real. I was scared to the bone. So many of us were and still are. 
But, my fear wasn’t the problem. 
My problem was all the focusing on the fear, anger, disappointment. Parts of my brain that had been reserved for creativity, action, growth, inspiration were now filled with all of that fear, anger and disappointment.

Now, I speak from experience. I would even venture to say that I owe positivity everything. I started my first business in 2011 with very little. $300 and positivity. Positivity just works. Positivity goes far beyond the words that are said aloud. I’ve been fortunate enough to go places, and experience beautiful things and people because I told myself I could. 
You see, its the words that we say to ourselves that pack the biggest punch. 
Fast forward to the beginning of 2017, and my sadness and heartache took over. 
I’ve had my fair share of difficulties and challenges but nothing could prepare me for the difficulty that would be in store when I handed that part of my brain that had been reserved for creativity over to negativity. To be clear, I did that. Trump has done many shitty things but he in fact did NOT change my positive outlook. I did that to myself. 
I am not going to exaggerate here. With that change came a whirlwind of sadness, frustration, time wastage, tears tears tears. Some days I found it difficult to peel myself out of bed. On other days I showered those around me with the internal pain that I was causing myself. I blamed it on everyone and everything else. Failed relationships, mean people, living in the south. You name it. 
Entire days were wasted on replaying painful situations in my mind. It just snowballed. 
And it began with a simple adjustment. A simple hand over. A hand over that was my choice and no one else’s. 

So now, in this brand new year, I am consciously taking my damn brain back.

You and I.

You are stronger.

Stronger than I will ever truly

Your way to stay strong.

Faded the scars;

The Past,

And you found a way to love,

And to be loved.

Stumbling is the loner's little,

Normal way of life.

Without all that you are just observing. You are the observer. But without all that I mentioned you have no sense of the self so there is only observing. When there is only observing you cannot be hurt. You cannot suffer psychologically. So the way not to suffer is to let go of everything more than the observing. Of course this can be very difficult. As soon as you will be able to see the difference between observing and everything more than observing. You will already be able to suffer less.

I'm 42 (M). My whole life, I have struggled with social anxiety. In high school, there was this girl I really liked and we became friends. But I could never tell her how I felt. My face would turn red and I would develop hives. When I finally did squeak out a confession of affection it was awkward, cringey and done via AOL Instant Messenger and she shut it down immediately.

I;m divorced. And the only reason I married was because my wife took the initiative and made the first move.

Years of therapy and introspection and I feel like I am improving myself for the better. I made friends with a woman who just turned 40. We have been very friendly but the vibes I was getting from her could all just be pure friendship focused.

Either way, I decided the best way to diffuse the situation was to stop being afraid of being told ""no"" and tell her how I feel. More than that, I am going to not make it a big, awkward scene like I might have done when I Was 16 and I thought life was a movie and a big dramatic reveal would result in us being together. I'm going to have a direct discussion, eye contact and all, with my friend about my feelings, assure her of how much I value our friendship, and not put her on the spot for a reply.

I fully expect a ""rejection"" for a whole slew of reasons I won't get into. But I'm not as anxious as I normally would be with something like this. I'm more excited to get it off of my chest. To me the risk of keeping this bottled up and it kicking around in my mind as a perpetual game of ""what if"" is less desirable than being told ""thanks but not interested.""

I'm going to take a risk because I don't want to be so afraid of taking risks anymore. And I've never been happier or more confident with a decision like this before.

2061,"For anyone dealing with Mental Health Problems I tried to post this elsewhere but got banned several times, yet people are making posts about being suicidal and no form of response to that. I hope this subreddit will reach at least a few people.

I planned on taking my own life at the age of 32. I had it all mapped out and knew the location where I wanted to go through with it. Do I have your attention now? Please give this a chance and read it till the end.

I am writing this because, in scrolling through Reddit recently, I am seeing a real uptick in people being depressed, suicidal, and worse. So I wanted to write this to tell you how I overcame and that YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

When I was 25 years old, I was severely depressed. If anyone on the outside saw me, they would have no idea that I struggled with a never-ending sadness that seemed to get worse as I grew older. Finally, I started to wonder if life was even worth living. I mean, if this sadness is what I have to look forward to as I get older, why not end my misery?

That's when I began planning it, down to the smallest detail. Seeing the suicide hotline info on the top of a google search page became an everyday occurrence. I was seriously looking up different ways to do it to be successful...

But a funny thing happened, age 32 came and went, and I was still here. I didn't go through with it. But why? It was a massive part of my twenties; why let it pass if life was so miserable for me? Strange enough, I started to look around and see that the people around me were in just as bad a state.

I looked to my family, my friendships, and the people around me and began to see the same problems I struggled with weighing heavily on their shoulders. It was then that I realized I was so sad because I was living my life for myself instead of dedicating it to helping the people around me.

Sounds like some bs, right? I mean, how would focusing on others instead of myself help me? Well, I thought the same thing. But, for once in my life, I decided to try something different instead of giving into those feelings. I started by anytime I felt like the world was on my shoulders, and I knew I could easily express those feelings to others in a rude way, instead, I started treating people how I wished people would treat me and spreading happiness to anyone I met.

Next, I went on a mission to figure out how everyone around me was doing. For so long, I had nothing inside of me to give to others, so I never bothered asking how others were doing. But now I began to see that my family was in disarray. The Elderly in my family were being completely ignored, and the younger ones were too sad to do anything to help. My response to this, of course, was Not My Family!! 

I began dedicating myself to helping my family like never before. I mowed lawns, took people to see the doctor, checked up on them, and gave them groceries. And holy crap, I was finally starting to feel happy again!!! I was making a difference in the lives of the people I love. And even better, I became an example to the younger people in my family and inspired them to help as well!

Here are a few other things that you can do that I promise will help if you try it consistently:

1. Exercise every day. David Goggins told me to kick my own ass, and I promise you that I feel so blessed since I have been doing it.
2. Eat the right food. You would be surprised how much fast food can affect your mental health. Instead, get fruits and vegetables in your diet and keep nutrition in mind.
3. Practice Gratefulness. I know it sounds like some bs but stick with me for a sec. Every day, we wake up cursing the gods for forcing us to go through another day. But what if, instead, you flipped the script and thanked this world for giving you another day to exist? I love to say wow, I can't believe this world gave me a yesterday AND a today; shit, if I get a tomorrow, it's game over, baby!!! We Won!!
4. Be the change you want to see in the world. At least for me, I would always look for help. For someone to come to rescue me from my sadness. But you have to understand that someone else just like you needs you to rise up and save them. You can be that person who changes their life and who they can look up to.

So, in conclusion, I wasn't supposed to be here today to give you this message. But maybe I was given a second chance to leave you with these words; I love you. If nobody else around you tells you that, know that I do. And I am rooting for you. I know you will do great things.

2115,"Top 5 Reasons why I have decided to STOP being a Pick Up Artist! If you like this post follow r/Crimsonpill

**Top 5 Reasons**

**Intro:** Guys, I plan on evolving from Pick Up Artist into **Life Optimization Mentor.** Many of you misunderstand what being a Pick Up Artist is. Hence you assume that PUA's are **'living the high life.**' *When the reality couldn't be further from the truth.* Most high value guys who are living the high life are not out there publicizing their lifestyle. In fact, most high value guys live a low key lifestyle since publicizing it would hurt their image.

**1--Most PUA's are businessmen**

Hence most PUA's don't care about seduction neither about teaching students. PUA's only care about making a profit. I remember a couple of PUA's confessed to me that they didn't really care if their students got laid or not. The objective was to get their students to sign up for a bootcamp. Once the student was done the PUA would relax and don't even bother. In fact, I remember run into a popular 'Guru' at Santa Monica Pier. He was eat and drink his burger and beer, while his students were creeping girls out with by mass approaching.

2-**Most PUA culture and industry is toxic**

It's a Clown Show: Students bashing Students, Gurus bashing their students, Gurus bashing other Gurus, the media bashing PUA's. PUA's taking advantage of women, women taking advantage of students, PUA taking advantage of their students. I doubt any of you guys want to be associated with this type of culture and industry.

3- **PUA's celebrate Gutter Punk Culture**

PUA are not teaching you guys to make money. They don't care if you are broke or not. Hence, many times PUA's will talk about living in a friend's basement and closing girls there. Or sleeping in a couch couch and closing girls there. After awhile, you start to realize that what they are telling you this **fantastic stories for marketing purposes.** They use you won't improve your SMV hence they have to make it seem that improving your finances doesn't matter when it does.

**4**\-**The minority of PUA's who are good are Dark Triad**

A lot of you guys reading this might assume that being, ""Dark Triad' is cool. However, it's the complete opposite. For a man to be dark triad is actually a **burden** that he has to carry around, **this approach to life makes his life harder not easier**. Tom Torero and I had discussion on Dark Triad and he was telling me that he thought people like that have some of the roughest lives. We seen Dark Triad PUA's being banned from malls, banned from websites, can't hold a steady job, be in debt. All sorts of horror stories.

**5-Following the PUA path won't make you a successful man**

My ultimate goal for you guys who is his boss, no roommates, no neighbors, no boss, no supervisor. A man who doesn't even work since he lives off passive income. A man who owns **property**. I have an acquaintance of mine who throws his parties at his house. He invites as many women as he wants to party. In contrast, the PUA's I know have turned into scammers while they do PUA they are also doing all sort of petit scams to rip off poor and naive people.

**Conclusion**: I will continue helping you guys but now my main focus will be **Life Optimization**. Under that banner I will continue to tell you about optimizing your dating strategy. However, I don't think you should limit yourself to dating for the purpose of finding a long term girlfriend/wife. Instead, you should open your mind to other options, like FWB, the culture has tremendously changed.

Its kind of weird to think that less than half a year ago I was suffering from such crippling depression that I literally didn't get out of my bed for days - if not weeks - on end, my room had dozens of flies in it from all the rotten food, I barely ever washed, I was malnourished and was regularly light headed from thirst and hunger, I was dreading the day when my utter failure at university would come out in the open. And somehow, worst of all was the fact that amongst all my colleagues, I should have had the easiest time; for me, my degree should have been a breeze in the park, yet I succumbed to a destructive spiral of total apathy and contrasting anxiety and failed my degree, while my fellow students succeeded with hard work and dedication I simply couldn't - or didn't - give. I felt like such a failure, because, well, I was.

I couldn't imagine being this ok with my life back then. Turns out I didn't even need the degree to get a job in its related field anyway; my pre-existing knowledge about the subject (Japanese Language, btw, and I'm half-Japanese/bilingual, hence why it should have been easy) was enough to get me the job, and now the job experience is more valuable.

Even better, once my contract ends in December (I'm optimistic that the contacts I've made will mean getting another contract in the future will be easier), I'm going to - and I'm not joking here - join a semester course to a circus school. Circus skills has been a passion of mine for (on-and-off) 15 years, so 'Running away to the circus' as cliche'd as that saying is, is something I've wanted to do for a very long time. But I kinda feel like I've matured as an adult enough to the point where I could viably pursue it. A single semester also means it isn't too long if I find difficulty with it as well. I really really hope it'll be amazing though - almost everything about circus skills has been amazing so far, after all.

I imagine there are quite a lot of people here that are themselves in a shitty place similar, or worse, to what used to be mine, right now... That really really sucks, and I'm so sorry you're there right now. Nobody deserves that. That might be hard to believe for some of you (I know I felt like I deserved what I got when I was depressed), but trust me: *you don't deserve to be depressed.*

I'm sharing how I got out in hopes that it may help some of you here. The way I got out of that dark time was thanks to 2 factors: taking little steps, and being forced into a corner. (Side note: sadly for me, medical help didn't really help me. I genuinely feel that the National Health Service failed me. *But that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek medical help, if you are capable of doing so.* I tried, it didn't help, but it *can* help for some people.)

The first one is advice for all elements of life. If you can't handle something, break it down into smaller and smaller steps until you find a step you're willing to take. For me, I broke it down all the way to trying to get out of my room and take a shower; the cleanliness of hot water was my first step. Yours may need to be a bigger step, or a smaller step.

Sometimes though, depression means that any step, no matter how small, isn't enough. I know it was for me, which was why I was stuck for such a long time. Just... *nothing* was easier than any small a step. I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't shower, couldn't nothing. Which was why the second factor was so important.

The second one isn't so great. Basically, my father was coming to my city for work-related stuff and wanted to see me. It was something I simply couldn't avoid; he knew where I lived, and my parents kinda knew something might be wrong by the fact I wasn't replying to their attempts at contact. My destructive life style was made possible by the fact that nobody knew how bad I was at: ordering takeaways online meant I didn't have to leave the house for food; my laptop and internet meant I could keep myself distracted from my own reality. But I couldn't avoid my parents any longer, as they would be literally knocking on my doorstep. I couldn't let them see me in that state; I had to get out of bed and get myself together, not completely, but at least to the point where I could tell them I needed help. 

I hope you don't get to the point where you're forced to act like this. Recovering from sheer shame kinda sucks. But it is an option. Simply waiting till you can't wait no longer, while not optimal, is certainly how I got out. Again, if you can avoid this step, goddammit avoid it. But for me at least, life forced me out of my horrible but comfortable rut, so maybe it can work for others too.

Goodluck, and I hope you can find yourself where I am now. Believe it or not, *you can do this.*",Depression,Neutral,0.90296555,[0.40536574 0.01424605 0.58038825],0.58038825,False

As selfish as that may seem, I would wish depression on nobody, it has helped me. That's why I'd like to share the quote I heard today that for the first time has me motivated to change the life I'm living. ""The first step in the process of mindful awareness is radical self-acceptance.""- Stephen Batchelor. It was from a book on meditation and yoga I saw on instagram. I'm not into yoga and meditation really, but the quote struck me really deep. It got me thinking that I just need to accept myself completely and go from there. Accept all the shitty terrible stuff I dislike about myself, along with the good bits about me. If I live life aware of all of myself and accept it I believe it'll make me strive toward being a better person and correcting the bad parts about me for the sake of myself.

2409,"A long story about the rain. This is going to be quite a long story so I’m sorry, but I want to share this as yesterday was one of the best moments of my life (as weird as that’s about to sound) but for you to fully understand I have to explain the worst moment of my life. Hope you’ve got your popcorn ready. There will be a TL;DR at the bottom. 

So at the time of writing I’m 18 and I’m doing relatively okay. 4 years ago when I was 14 I was hit by a car going 40 mph (64 kph). I was walking home from school with a couple friends and someone who was ALLEGEDLY (I can’t actually prove this but I’ve been told by multiple people) high behind the wheel of a small Ford, lost control of the car. He mounted the pavement where me and my friends were walking and hit me and 2 others (we’ll call them Adam and Phil). I have no recollection of this day because I was instantly knocked out, but I’ve also been told that I pushed my friend out the way which I really want to believe is true but honestly I don’t know if it is. It sounds straight from a superhero movie. Anyway irregardless, the car ran over Adam’s foot and he was obviously unable to walk so he was on crutches. Phil was okay, he got the best of it out of us 3, a few minor cuts and bruises. I drew the short straw here and took the cars full force head on. I suffered lacerations to my cheek and chin, a fractured cheek bone, a fractured skull, the entire left side of my face from the bottom of my eye down is paralysed (I cant feel anything or move anything) and I was leaking fluid from my nose for a couple weeks which we think was fluid from the brain. I had a couple issues elsewhere but it was mainly severe head trauma. Like I said, it’s the worst moment of my life. 

I’ve been all up and down the UK seeing specialists from therapists to neurologists to neuropsychologists. What’s most relevant here is the therapists. It’s been a long 4 years, I’ve had rapid mood swings, PTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline paranoia. But through heavy therapy I’m slowly on the mend. Up until very recently I haven’t been able to leave the house without my mother and my dog (I love you mum and I love you just as much Frank). If I even thought of leaving the house or the topic was brought up I’d have a panic attack. In this time I’ve lost all my friends because life goes on, they all have boyfriends, girlfriends, jobs and responsibilities to take care of. But exactly one week ago, I had enough. I was sick and tired of being afraid. I didn’t want to stay in my room all day. I didn’t want to keep putting on weight (I’m now 22 stones). I had enough. So I made a vlog on my personal Snapchat saying that I’m going to document every day. And every day for one week, I’m getting out of the house. Even if it was just standing outside for 10 minutes, it’s still better than nothing. And it really helped. I documented each day and people I haven’t spoken to in years pushed and supported me to no end. I can now go on a 15 minute walk every morning by myself and I’ve done that 3 days in a row now. 

Yesterday was special though. I started my walk and I was out for maybe 3 minutes before a couple raindrops fell. I looked up and there was a rain cloud above me. A drop of rain hit my face. I was about to turn around and go back inside and wait until later but I decided not to. About halfway around my walk it was raining, not heavy, but heavy enough to have an umbrella. And I couldn’t believe it. This was my first time experiencing being outside in the rain in 4 years, in all honesty, I completely forgot what rain felt like. And I was so happy that I started crying. I got a couple looks from people but I didn’t care. I was an 18 year old boy crying because it was raining. I stayed outside until it stopped which was about 45 minutes. I was almost outside for an hour because of the rain, which is the longest amount of time I’ve spent outside in 4 years. 

It’s made me appreciate the smaller things in life, everything I’m taking for granted. Everything my mum does around the house with the cleaning, the cooking and all the shit jobs nobody wants to do, I’m going to have to move out one day and miss all that. Everything my stepdad does to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. Everything my grandparents do. The water from the tap or the lights I can turn on with a switch. I appreciate all that so much more now. And that makes me smile. 

Remember everyone, tell your parents you love them. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR:
I was hit by a car 4 years ago. Since then it’s been a struggle to leave the house. After 4 years I can finally leave the house. It rained yesterday when I was outside which is something I haven’t experienced in years. I forgot what rain felt like. I cried because I was happy that it was raining. Tell your parents you love them.",Neutral,Depression,1.3364096,[0.72776157 0.00945087 0.26278752],0.72776157,False
2466,"Miracles do exist. I had a breakthrough moment this morning. My memory is starting to come back at lightning speed... After years of unexplained amnesia I have finally been able to remember parts of my life. They're so clear I can almost smell how my old house smelt. I can almost feel what it was like to dance at the skatepark. I don't know why this is happening. Perhaps it's because I'm starting to make my way out of the clouds and can almost see the sun again? Have I just now become truly self aware? Am I ascending spiritually? I didn't even know what memories actually were until today. Does that sound strange? Even if it did.. Fuck it. I don't care how strange it sounds. Because I can now experience and feel something that I have never felt before, and it is so delightful. Today is a blessing. Memories are a blessing. Life is a blessing.

It is my ultimate goal now to go have as many incredible experiences in my life as I possibly can, because I never want this bliss to end.

2494,"Feel like 80% of my life problems would be solved by learning to be happy for others Hi!

This is my first post on Reddit, not sure if I'm posting in the correct community even. I'm just looking for some guidance on how to approach this toxic mindset that is doing me no good.

Basically, I've become increasingly envious/jealous of certain people, and the blessings they've been given. I recognise that everyone has their hardships and majority of the time I only hold their life in high-regard because I'm seeing the highlights of their life. Which is fine; I accept that with social media very few people are going to be their authentic selves online. But I feel a lot of my problems are rooted in me wanting others not to have something good - if I see someone with a happy relationship, rather than just wanting it for myself as well, I **also** don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a great job offer, I don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a supportive family relationship, I'd rather they don't have it. Sometimes its things that I have myself, but I don't want others to have.

I get triggered everytime I see someone have something that I feel is a blessing, because it brings about deep feelings of envy to the point where I want that thing to be taken away from them.

A key example being a girl on Instagram who posted about her married life being 'amazing' so far. She probably meant well, and she was actually asked about it from her followers so wasn't just an off-the-cuff braggy post. And she seems like a genuinely nice person; always happy to help others and seems sweet in her replies. But as soon as she posted that, I feel so envious of her. I even Googled 'when does the Honeymoon Period of a relationship end?', which came up with a 12-18 month average post-marriage estimate. Then looked at when she got married, timed how long she had left until her Honeymoon Period would start to fizzle out, and felt better about myself that she was past the 12-month mark. Insane, I know. And it feels me with deep sadness typing that out, because that is just one example of many. I probably do something like this every 1 to 2 days. Again, insane.

This is why I came to confine in the lovely community of Reddit. What do I even do with myself? I genuinely want to be happy for others. I know I have a lot to be happy about in my life, and even where I have problems (like every other human), I want to work on them rather than wanting others to have the same/similar issues in their life. But I want to start with being able to look at someone's life, and be truly happy for them, and to want whatever blessing they have to increase. How do I go about doing so?",Neutral,Depression,1.668941,[0.80454063 0.00701289 0.1884465 ],0.80454063,False

2653,"Guys, I'm better I'm happy again.

I was so worried because my girlfriend was going away, and it would be a long distance relationship deal. I was stressing over not seeing her anymore. I cried myself to sleep every night, cried at least an hour during the day, and was not happy.


Then we broke up.




All of the stress related to her has been lifted. I don't need to worry anymore. After reading yall's thoughts for the duration of this, I figured you should hear how I got better.



I don't feel totally qualified to give advice, but what I think would help some of you is


&gt;find the source of your stress


&gt;try and remove it from your life. It'll seem hard, but it helped me immensely.

2664,"Customer service is a pain sometimes Not sure if this is the right place for this, and sorry in advance for the writing quality, I'm an engineering student.

About a year ago, I purchased a Surface Pro 4 for note taking in college. I have never had issues with it and I have loved using it. Yesterday, however, I was taking notes in my first class of the day and the screen decided to shut off. I thought this was odd and tried turning it off and back on again. That didn't work, so I went to google and tried some solutions I found there, again no luck. After class, I went over to the campus tech store and asked them to take a look and they told me I would have to go to the Microsoft store if I wanted to get anything done. At this point, I was still hopeful that my computer was going to be alright.

Fast forward to that evening, I tried a few more solutions and still, nothing worked. I called the Microsoft store and asked if they had any times available for a tech consultation, and they told me they had one spot left at 8:45 (they closed at 9:00). I quickly gathered my things and drove to the mall where the store is located and spent a good 10 minutes wandering around the mall trying to find the Microsoft store (I had never been to this mall and it is half indoor, half outdoor). I finally find the store and a service tech, let's call him Mike, comes out to take a look at my computer.

He tries turning it off and back on again, and then tries some more advanced recovery tactics, each one failing. I tell him I bought the computer from Amazon (not a Microsoft store), and that I had not purchased extended coverage for it. He pulls up the serial number for my computer and tells me the default insurance expired 2 months ago. At this point, I was pretty disappointed, even more so when he told me my best option was to buy a refurbished replacement computer for $600.

I calmly told him that I couldn't make that purchase at the moment, and needed to call my parents first to see if they would pitch in some money to help me buy a replacement (even though I knew this was unlikely). He said that was fine, but he had one of his co-workers go in the back and see if there was even a Pro 4 in stock for me to pick up later in the week. His co-worker came back carrying a box and said ""Mike, we didn't have any Pro 4's but we have a Pro 5"", and Mike turned to me and said ""Well mrbutters58, it's your lucky day. I'm going to take care of you.""

My first thought when he said this was *He is going to try to upsell me a new model for $600, even though I just said I can't afford to pay that much.* He takes the new model out of the box for me to see, and proceeds to remove my keyboard and pen from my broken unit and place the broken unit back in the box he just took the Pro 5 out of. At this point, I spoke up, ""Mike, hold on, I told you I can't pay for this tonight.""

He looked at me and said, ""I know, don't worry about it, I told you I was going to take care of you."" I sat for a moment and processed what he had just said and asked what exactly he meant, and he replied ""I told you, I'm going to take care of you. Your warranty is only 2 months expired and even though this is out of the norm, I'm just going to exchange your device and this one, no charge"". He proceeded to print out a receipt that had 2 items on it, one Surface Pro 5 exchange ($0.00) and one Surface Pro 4 return ($0.00). I took the receipt and read it, looked up to see Mike smiling at me and he says ""Have a good night, mrbutters58, I hope you do well in your classes"". I thanked him profusely and walked out feeling great.

This may be standard procedure for Microsoft, I'm not sure. Regardless, I have had countless bad experiences with customer service and Mike from Microsoft changed that for me. He could have easily stuck to the ""$600 Pro 4 replacement"" option and I would not be writing this right now on the device he exchanged for me. Maybe this isn't a huge deal, but as a broke student paying my own way through college, $600 is a lot of money, so Mike if you're on Reddit and reading this, thank you so much. It means more than you could know. If not, to the rest of you just know that not all customer service representatives are out to get your money, some really do care about the customer.",Neutral,Happy,2.574881,[0.057275   0.8665621  0.07616289],0.8665621,False

Well as it turns out they never charged my debit card. Interestingly enough this isn't the first or even the best time something like this has happened.

Five years ago I bought a Samsung TV from a Best Buy in Dallas, the only thing was I wanted to pick it up in Lubbock since I didn't have a way to transport it. I gave the Best Buy in Dallas my card and they ran it, I went to pick up the TV in Lubbock and everything was great. Well a week later I still have a couple grand more then I should in my account, as it turns out Best Buy never charged me for the TV. The best part is when I bought the TV not only did I get the salesman to throw in a home stereo system but I bought the warranty. Two years later that Samsung TV goes out, I contact Best Buy and they give me another Samsung TV no problem. They ask me if I want to get a warranty and of course I agree, well a year later that TV goes out and they send me another new Samsung TV.

3280,"Every problem has its solution. I'm a programmer, I should Know. Well .. a programmer who is still in college, living in an overcrowded housing situation .. coming from a background of poverty and psychological trauma. Social isolation. But yeah .. it's my passion, pretty much. It's what I wanna do. (I do hope I can get something better than an crappy office job, though.. that's not what I signed up for...)

You know one thing about this subreddit that I've noticed? There's not enough people in it. It needs more people.

In my view, real positivity isn't about just putting on a fake smile and pretending that everything's fine with the world. 

For me, it's about viewing life as just one big sheet of code. Bugs just need to be located, and fixed. Apply the scientific method to everything you do, eat healthy. Sleep well. Exercise. Clean syntax.

3620,"In your darkest hour, hope is something that you give yourself I am making the decision to move on.

I was depressed before I went to university and ended up choosing a school based on a program I didn't fully investigate that I didn't really know I wanted to do because my girlfriend was going there and I thought I loved her. That didn't last, depression kicked in when my school went on strike for 4 months in my first year, I was a lazy kid in high school and this long break to drink and do nothing didn't help me learn how to study.

I dropped out after my second year and I spent the next year doing nothing, I've been trying to get my life together these past few months and I've been looking for a job since February - a real job away from retail hell where I can pay back my OSAP loans, pay back my parents (who were gracious enough to not accept that I had fucked up school but that I had also fucked up my debts and repaid the school so I wasn't getting huge interest charges added on), and more importantly, to go back to school later on.

This last point, getting a degree, is crucial, because you see I'm not having any luck finding a job because I don't have a degree and I don't have dedicated experience working in IT, even though I am fully (sometimes over!) qualified for these jobs. There's other stuff I can do, I can work on certifications and do freelance work to get experience, I've known I can do it, but I haven't done much on this point because there is always a reason, always something to distract me - no more.

I'm drawing my sword and cutting my way out of this loop, I refuse to continue spending my days hoping; hoping that I will have enough money to pay my rent, hoping I will have enough money to eat this week, hoping that I'll get a call about a job, hoping that an interview will go well, hoping that I won't wake up wanting a drink and end a day wanting to give up entirely. I'm going to bed soon and I work at 1600 tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and start working and start studying because I am going to fulfill my heretofore wasted potential and do my best and even if I fail, I will know that at least I did every god damn thing in my power not to.

Two years ago I left a really traumatic situation. I was seeing a therapist but she moved shortly after I left the situation. I became really distrustful of therapists and, despite being diagnosed with PTSD, generalised anxiety disorder, and depression I was convinced I'd ""get over it"" by myself. 

And I have made some really huge progress on my own. I got a whole master's degree. I raised a really cool cat. I got a puppy and am raising him to be am amazing therapy dog and athlete. I became a Muay Thai fighter. I started dating this really awesome dude despite my trauma. I did a lot of work on myself by myself.

But now I feel like I'm treading water and running out of energy. My job destroyed me. I was working 60 hour weeks, on the weekends, only being paid for a third of my hours, in a constantly negative environment. I got very, very sick this summer and almost bled out because of a severe reaction to a common, generic pill. My puppy is awesome but raising a puppy is hard on its own, even harder when combined with the unexpected shit that that happened these last few months.

I'm crashing. Lately I've been constantly depressed, paranoid, and angry. I have these intense thoughts of hurting myself. When I get woken up in the middle of the night by my puppy I feel this intense anger. Last week I fantasised about drinking bleach while I was half asleep after my puppy woke me up with his whining. I cry randomly throughout the day. It is so hard to find a reason to get out of bed. I am so so so angry and depressed. I feel like I'm losing it. I'm going crazy. And it makes me so goddam mad because I should have had these feelings two years ago when the trauma was fresh. Why the fuck are they suddenly all hitting me now when I'm supposed to be moving on with my life?

I told my mom about these feelings and she told me she was scared and I needed to get therapy. That she'd pay for it. This is a woman who my whole life did not believe in mental health or therapy. But my feelings are so scary that even she was convinced I need help. Fuck I guess I really am fucked up.

I've put off therapy for two years because I don't trust therapists anymore and I'm so scared of addressing all this dark, rotten shit inside of me.

4453,"Dressed up for the first time in a long time. It's been years since I last did anything at all for Halloween. I think I stopped caring about it when I first made my transition into 'teenhood', thinking it was pointless. It was only a week before Halloween when I thought of dressing up and the idea came about during a pretty bad slump. I just wanted to do something different or opposed to my usual character. Maybe donning a different outfit for a day would change something you know?",Depression,Neutral,1.6732469,[0.18763687 0.01360258 0.79876053],0.79876053,False
4478,"The other day I found out that this really great girl I've been seeing for a while has been leading me on for over a month... So yea, I found that out the other day when I heard from some people that she was seen with another guy to a party over the weekend. Come to find out, the guy is a close friend of mine and they fucked in his car after the party... I bought her a really nice Christmas gift that I know will mean a lot to her but now I don't really know if giving it to her is a great idea. She collects vinyl records so I got her this really nice original mint condition black sabbath album for Christmas. After hearing about what happened though neither her or my friend have said much to me the past few days... I feel cheated and lied too because apparently this wasn't just a one time thing. Deep down I think I always knew that it would never work out. She's from a really well off family, and has always had everything her heart desires, and I'm just a poor boy. My parrents have always struggled to make ends meet... Until recently I lived in a small one story house on a dirt road, I never really had much and so I'm pretty easy to please... It's true what they say you know, rich girls don't date poor boys. But I know that she's used to that kind of lifestyle so I spoiled her, I wanted her to know I wasn't like my parrents... Sad broke and alone... From the moment we started hanging out together my life changed in so many ways... I was happier, more confident, I smiled more, I talked to people more almost two months ago I thought things had started to get somewhat serrious when she kissed me one night when I took her home, after that we began going steady somewhat but still without a title. I took her on dates, we went to concerts we had made out a few times, but I thought she just really wanted to take it slow... After hearing about what's been going on behind my back though that perfect bubble I'd been living I. Finally popped. My world came crashing down and now I don't really care much for anything that used to make me happy... I don't like the same songs because they remind me of her, I don't like the same foods, I don't go to the same places... All I wanna do is get shit facedand get stoned in my closet, I've been an emotional wreck on the inside all finals week so far and I just don't really know how much more school I can take right now. I'm confused and hurt and sad and angry at myself all at the same time. Most days I wake up to look in the mirror and I hate myself. I try and I try to pick out something, anything about myself that I like, and I just can't think of anything. I hate my eyes, my smile, I'm too short, I wish I had harder abs or atleast a flatter stomach, my hands and feet are oddly small of a guy, I'm too short, I hate my hair, my complexion is ok maybe 3-4 out of every 10 days or so... I just I've realized that I just wasn't good enough for her... That's my place in the universe now I guess. None of us get to choose the lives were born into, I never wanted this. I just wish I couldn't feel at all sometimes maybe then I'd be at peace. Maybe then I wouldn't feel so bad about where I'm at right now. All I know is I fell in love, real love... True love with someone I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with, and because I was so stupid... I opened up and gave her my heart let her know just how much she meant to me, now, I lost her... ",Depression,Neutral,1.0464051,[0.35119802 0.00679623 0.64200574],0.64200574,False
